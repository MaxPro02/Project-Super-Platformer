# Project-Super-Platformer
Game Built in 2D.

    • Project overview
The overview of this project, is a functioning 2D game that meets the requirements stated in each of the SR’s below.

    • Detailed description of each feature/component
Start Screen is where the User will decide whether they will play the game or quit the game. On the start screen there should be a start button or an exit game button.

There should be levels to the game, depending on the requirements that should decide on how many levels are required for this game. But there should be an easy level, Difficult level and a Boss level

The Main player should be able to move around with Arrow Keys or WASD as there main movement, the player should also have animations for idle, run, attack, and death. With these animations in place, Pressing spacebar will show the attack animation which should also deal damage to enemies inside of the hit-range. When the player is at 0 health the player should die and the death animation will run.

Enemies are either idle standing still or are roaming the level waiting for the Player to be in range of there melee attacks or ranged attacks, depending on the enemy for example a standard enemy shouldn’t have that much health but instead a lot of standard enemies to increase the level difficulty before the player reaches the boss level. The Enemies should be able to damage the player leaving them with 1 HP or 2HP depending on the damage imputed onto the enemy. 

The Boss character will be the final level of the game and should be harder than the other levels. The boss should not be a hit 2 - 10 hit boss. The boss should be hard to kill with an enraged ability that makes him harder to kill. The health bar above the boss will display how low he is and when he gets to a certain % of health he should get enraged and deal more damage to your player. Once the boss dies the game should end depending on the requirements of the 2D game.



    • Software Requirements
The Game itself isn’t demanding at all, and won't require any specific software requirements to run it as it's a light 2D game which anything can run it.

    • Deployment
The game will be compiled into an EXE for the user to run from their device, or the Source can be found on the Owners github repository.
